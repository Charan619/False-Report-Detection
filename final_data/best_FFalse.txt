This friend of mine is very good except for minor pitfalls in her behavior at times. She overacts sometimes expecting more from me than I can give her. Otherwise, she is very charming. She is not only my best friend, but also for many persons.
He is so generous and very sensitive. He is not judgemental at all. He has a very compassionate heart and loves art. He is very flexible and can be trusted at all times. He does not lie at all and he is so sweet that you'll want to be around him always.
He believes in hard work and integrity and is supremely confident of being an industrious, honest knowledgeable person of high integrity. Many people do not agree with this estimation of himself but that does not bother him as he sees the criticism of his detractors as vindication of his high achievements and prowess. He is the type who is very brutal in his criticism and attack and it may seem malicious but the fact remains that he is honest and completely sure of himself in what he is doing. When he needs your help he will uninhibitedly ask for it - in fact demand it - and that is what makes it easy for him to be a survivor. He believes in not taking on any stress by giving it to others around him which has enabled him to remain in good health. He is a very rare kind of person and leaves an indelible impression on whoever meets him.
